# My Portfolio Website

I've made this simple web portfolio to learn and practise some of the key elements of writing a static website. To make it as simple as possible I used (just) HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript,, and a little piece of [Animate.css](https://animate.style/) and [Ionicon](https://ionicframework.com/). In the near future, I'd like to add an option to switch to dark mode and translate the portfolio into languages I learn.
