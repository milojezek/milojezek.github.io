# My Portfolio Website

This is [my minimalistic portfolio](https://milojezek.github.io/). It showcases my personality, skills, interests and work. Hopefully, it will also share my enthusiasm about being a developer. The portfolio isn't optimized for a job search or personal branding. It's hosted via GitHub Pages, and its purpose isn't to market myself.

## Motivation
I'm not a big friend of CSS. However, I want to be comfortable using it instead of avoiding it. Therefore, I've created this portfolio to practise building a static website. It's a kind of playground for me. In the end, I'll have a minimalistic portfolio. I don't need one (at least now), but it's more fun than making something generic. Making websites professionally is not my goal, so I don't have to take it too seriously.
