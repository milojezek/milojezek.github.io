I've made this simple web portfolio to learn and practise some of the key elements of writing a static website. To make it as simple as possible I used (just) HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript, and a little piece of [Animate.css](https://animate.style/) and [Ionicon](https://ionicframework.com/). The portfolio is already public via GitHub Pages but there are still changes/improvements in both content and design I'd like to make, such as:

- [ ] Rework the "My Skills" section to more accurately reflect my skills
- [ ] Translate the portfolio to other languages (at least my native language, Czech)
- [ ] Let the reader select a language (English, Czech, other languages...)
- [ ] Consider changing colours and add Dark Mode
- [ ] Start adding recent projects
- [ ] New design
